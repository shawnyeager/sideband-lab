## Adding a new project

When the user wants to add a new project (e.g. "add a project called X"), scaffold it automatically:

### 1. Create the Astro page route

Create `src/pages/[slug]/index.astro` with this exact template:

```astro
---
import fs from 'node:fs';
import path from 'node:path';
import Project from '../../layouts/Project.astro';

const htmlPath = path.resolve('public/[slug]/index.html');
const html = fs.readFileSync(htmlPath, 'utf-8');

const headContent = html.match(/<head[^>]*>([\s\S]*?)<\/head>/i)?.[1] || '';
const bodyContent = html.match(/<body[^>]*>([\s\S]*?)<\/body>/i)?.[1] || '';
---

<Project slug="[slug]" headContent={headContent} bodyContent={bodyContent} />
```

Replace `[slug]` with the actual slug. The `Project` layout handles font preloads, OG meta, and the site header. Do NOT use raw `Response` — it breaks HMR and View Transitions.

### 2. Create `public/[slug]/` directory

The user will add their standalone `index.html` here. It must have `<head>` and `<body>` tags (the Astro route injects font preloads into head and the fixed header into body).

Project HTML should follow these conventions (see `public/http-402/index.html` as the canonical reference):
- **Use shared classes from `projectHeader` (`src/lib/header.ts`).** It provides font-face declarations, body/heading font overrides, fixed header, AND shared CSS classes. Do NOT redefine fonts, accordions, prose, dividers, or footers — use the classes it provides:
  - `.title-block` (with `h1` + `.subtitle`) — page heading within 728px reading column
  - `.project-prose` — body text paragraphs within 728px reading column
  - `.disclosure` (with `summary` containing `.chev` span + `.disclosure-body`) — accordions
  - `.hr-subtle` — divider between prose and disclosures
  - `.project-credit` — footer credit line
- Reading column: max-width 728px, centered via `margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto`. Applies to h1, subtitle, body text, accordions, HRs, and footer credit line. Charts/visuals can be wider (940px).
- Type scale for 728px column: body 20px, subtitle 20px, detail-summary 16px, detail-body 15px, footer 14px. h1 stays 34px.
- Footer: left-aligned credit line within the 728px centered column. No subscribe CTA on project pages.
- Fonts injected by projectHeader: Roboto Slab for h1-h4, Lora for body, Space Grotesk for UI. Raw HTML pages don't get global.css — projectHeader handles font loading and overrides. **Do NOT declare your own @font-face rules for these fonts** — they will conflict.
- All `<img>` tags must have `alt`, `width`, `height`, and `loading` attributes. All icon-only `<a>` tags must have `aria-label`.

### 3. Add entry to `src/content/projects.json`

```json
{
  "slug": "[slug]",
  "title": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "thumbnail": "[slug]",
  "ogImage": "/img/og/[slug].png",
  "status": "draft"
}
```

- `thumbnail`: Just the slug name (no path, no extension). Must match a file at `src/assets/projects/[slug].png`. Used by the homepage card via Astro's `<Image>` component for build-time optimization.
- `ogImage`: Full path relative to `public/`. Must be a real file at `public/img/og/[slug].png`. Used for Open Graph / Twitter Card meta tags — social crawlers fetch this directly, so it must be a static file in `public/`.

Optional fields: `substackUrl`, `substackTitle` (shown on the card as a link).

Set status to `"draft"` initially. The homepage only shows `"live"` projects (filtered by `getActiveProjects()` in `src/lib/utils.ts`). Change to `"live"` once the HTML, thumbnail, and OG image are in place.

### 4. Generate preview images with agent-browser

Two image files are required per project. **Generate them automatically** — do not ask the user to provide them.

Prerequisites: the project HTML must be in place and the dev server running at `localhost:4321`. Requires `agent-browser` and `magick` (ImageMagick).

Use agent-browser CLI commands to capture screenshots. For clipped regions, take a full screenshot and crop with ImageMagick. Template:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e
SLUG="[slug]"
SCALE=2

agent-browser set viewport 1200 900 "$SCALE"
agent-browser open "http://localhost:4321/${SLUG}/"

# If the page has animations, wait for a completion indicator:
# agent-browser wait '.done-indicator'

# Clean up for capture — hide header, set background
agent-browser eval "(() => {
  const header = document.querySelector('#site-header');
  if (header) header.style.display = 'none';
  document.body.style.paddingTop = '0';
  document.body.style.background = '#1D2733';
})()"

# THUMBNAIL — element screenshot of the VISUALIZATION ONLY
# CRITICAL: Capture ONLY the chart/canvas/SVG — NOT the page title, subtitle,
# description, filters, or any other page chrome. The homepage card already
# displays the project title and description below the thumbnail, so including
# them in the image creates ugly redundancy.
# Get bounding box of the primary visual element
THUMB=$(agent-browser --json eval "(() => {
  const viz = document.querySelector('.primary-visual-selector');
  const r = viz.getBoundingClientRect();
  return JSON.stringify({x: Math.round(r.x), y: Math.round(r.y), w: Math.round(r.width), h: Math.round(r.height)});
})()" | jq -r '.data // .')

agent-browser screenshot --full /tmp/ab-full-$$.png
TX=$(echo "$THUMB" | jq ".x * $SCALE")
TY=$(echo "$THUMB" | jq ".y * $SCALE")
TW=$(echo "$THUMB" | jq ".w * $SCALE")
TH=$(echo "$THUMB" | jq ".h * $SCALE")
magick /tmp/ab-full-$$.png -crop "${TW}x${TH}+${TX}+${TY}" +repage "src/assets/projects/${SLUG}.png"

# OG IMAGE — 1200:630 aspect ratio crop of the visualization
# For tall elements, clip to the most informative portion
OG_H=$(echo "$THUMB" | jq "[.h, (.w * 630 / 1200 | floor)] | min * $SCALE")
magick /tmp/ab-full-$$.png -crop "${TW}x${OG_H}+${TX}+${TY}" +repage "public/img/og/${SLUG}.png"

rm -f /tmp/ab-full-$$.png
agent-browser close
```

Key rules:
- `deviceScaleFactor: 2` always — retina-quality captures
- **Thumbnail must be ONLY the visualization** — the chart, canvas, SVG, or simulation. Never include the page title, subtitle, description, filter controls, or any text that the homepage card already shows. The card renders title + description below the image, so baking them into the thumbnail creates redundancy.
- Hide the site header and set `body.background` to the visualization's background color so no cream bleeds at edges
- Also hide page-level headings (h1, subtitle, description) before capture so they don't appear at the top of the screenshot
- Remove `border-radius` on the captured element if it has rounded corners
- For animated pages, wait for the completion state before capturing
- For tall visualizations that don't fit 1200:630, collapse expandable content (accordions, detail blocks) before the OG capture
- Verify both images look correct by reading them with the Read tool after generation. Check that no page title/subtitle text appears in the thumbnail.

### 5. Flip to live

Once images are generated and verified:
1. Change `"status": "draft"` to `"status": "live"` in `projects.json`
2. Run `npm run build` to verify zero errors
3. Report what was created

## Pre-push checklist

**MANDATORY before every push.** Do not push if any item fails.

### For new projects:
- [ ] `src/pages/[slug]/index.astro` exists and injects `projectHeader` + `projectMeta`
- [ ] `public/[slug]/index.html` exists with `<head>` and `<body>` tags
- [ ] `src/content/projects.json` entry has ALL required fields: `slug`, `title`, `description`, `date`, `thumbnail`, `ogImage`, `status`
- [ ] Thumbnail exists at `src/assets/projects/[slug].png`
- [ ] OG image exists at `public/img/og/[slug].png`
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds with zero errors

### For all pushes:
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds with zero errors
- [ ] No broken OG image paths — verify `projectMeta()` output resolves to real files
- [ ] Every `<img>` has `alt`, `width`, `height`, and `loading` attributes (`eager` for above-fold, `lazy` for below)
- [ ] Every icon-only `<a>` has `aria-label`; every SVG inside a link has `aria-hidden="true"`
- [ ] All images in `src/assets/` that are referenced by `projects.json` exist
- [ ] All images in `public/img/og/` that are referenced by `projects.json` exist
- [ ] Astro dev toolbar audit shows zero accessibility and zero performance issues

## Conventions
- No decorative elements. If it doesn't carry meaning, it doesn't belong.
- Every project links back to its companion Substack post.
- Projects own their content area. The shell (header/footer) is shared.
- Page background matches sideband.pub: cream (#EEEBE4). Header is always cream. Projects own their content canvas (dark visualizations are fine as islands within cream).
- **No hardcoded values in CSS.** Use design tokens from `global.css` (`--space-*`, `--text`, `--text-muted`, `--font-display`, etc.). If a token doesn't exist, create one. Never inline magic numbers for spacing, colors, or font sizes when a variable exists or should exist.

## Image rules

Every `<img>` tag — whether in Astro components, raw HTML project pages, or template strings like `header.ts` — must have:
- `alt` — descriptive text (or `alt=""` for purely decorative images)
- `width` and `height` — explicit dimensions to prevent layout shift
- `loading` — `"eager"` for above-the-fold (header icon, hero images), `"lazy"` for everything else

For icon-only links (`<a>` containing only an SVG or image with no visible text):
- The `<a>` must have `aria-label` describing the link destination
- Any `<svg>` inside must have `aria-hidden="true"`

Use Astro's `<Image>` component (`astro:assets`) for images in `.astro` files — it handles format conversion, responsive sizing, and attribute generation. Raw `<img>` tags are only for injected HTML strings (e.g. `projectHeader` in `header.ts`) and standalone project HTML in `public/`.

## Design Context

### Users
Founders, builders, and investors following AI infrastructure shifts. They know what an API is, what Lightning is, what a stablecoin is. They arrive from the Sideband newsletter (sideband.pub) and want to see an idea made tangible — not explained from scratch.

### Brand Personality
**Sharp, curious, structural.** The lab maps territory. It finds patterns in complex systems and makes them visible. No sales pitch, no thought-leadership posturing, no decoration for its own sake.

### Voice Rules

**Read `VOICE.md` (symlinked in project root) before writing any copy.** It is the canonical voice reference for all Sideband writing.

Key rules for project copy (titles, subtitles, descriptions in `projects.json`):
- Em dashes have **no spaces**: `word—word` not `word — word`
- No format-describing copy ("An interactive comparison of..."). Lead with the insight or tension, not the container.
- No CTAs or reader-addressing ("See how...", "Try this..."). State claims directly.
- No hedging ("I think", "arguably", "it seems").
- All featured copy must pass the humanizer skill before committing. No AI slop.
- Match the register of existing descriptions: short, punchy, specific. State what the project reveals, not what it is.

### Emotional Goals
- **Clarity.** The visitor sees something they didn't see before. Complexity resolved, not simplified.
- **Respect.** The work assumes intelligence. No hand-holding, no dumbing down, no explainers for things the audience knows.
- **Curiosity.** The visitor wants to explore further and share what they found.

### Aesthetic Direction
- **Reference:** Pudding.cool — visual essays that explain through interaction, not decoration. Each project earns its format.
- **Anti-references:** Startup marketing (gradient blobs, hero illustrations, "Schedule a demo" energy). Dashboard SaaS (dense grids, metric tiles, sidebar navs).
- **Theme:** Cream background (#EEEBE4) with dark visualization islands (#1D2733). The shell is warm and quiet. The visualizations are dense and precise. Contrast between the two is deliberate — the data lives in a different register than the prose.
- **Mode:** Light only. No dark mode. The cream background is the brand.

### Design Principles
1. **No decoration.** If it doesn't carry meaning, it doesn't belong. Every visual element must earn its place by making something clearer.
2. **Interaction over illustration.** Show the system working, not a picture of the system. Animated sequences, force simulations, explorable data — not static infographics.
3. **The visualization is the argument.** The prose frames it, the data proves it. If the visualization doesn't change what the reader understands, it failed.
4. **Respect the reader's time.** Fast load, immediate clarity, no preamble. The project should communicate its thesis within seconds of the first scroll.
5. **Each project owns its tools.** No framework mandate. Use D3, React, Svelte, vanilla JS, WebGL — whatever the visualization demands. The shell is shared; the content is sovereign.
